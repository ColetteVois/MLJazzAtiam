**Project :** Predict chord progressions of jazz music, represented as coherent chord label sequences with the help of probabilistic models.

**Domain :** Machine Learning

**Mentor :** Tristan Carsault

**Description :** This project aims to predict chord progressions of jazz music, represented as coherent chord label sequences with the help of probabilistic models. In this study, we propose to use different neural network models to generate symbolic chord sequences. Besides, we study the impact of the introduction of different musical distances through the loss function during the training of our models. Thus, we want to improve existing methods by doing multi-step prediction and by injecting music theory knowledge through the learning method in order to be able to perform accurate prediction of chord sequence and jazz melody generation. Ultimately, this project could be used to perform automatic accompaniment and improvisation.
